How to run:
1. In the file main.py: choose the order of the curve (variable name - phc_order). The larger the order of the curve, 
the more time it will take to calculate the curve and to draw it.
2. In the file main.py: choose how fast to draw the curve (variable name - frequency). The higher the frequency, the 
faster the curve will be drawn. For larger curve orders (7 or more), it's recommended to set frequency to 0, so the curve will be 
drawn as fast as possible.
3. Run main.py
